# River Environment Classification

REC2 includes a geospatial map showing all streams in New Zealand, classified into stream orders. The FCP uses this to map all 3rd-order streams within our four study areas (Gisborne, Hawkes Bay, Nelson City, Tasman and Marlborough).  Each 3rd-order stream and its surrounding subcatchment is classified as a CMU (Figure 3). The CMUs defined using this method range in size from 100 ha to 5,000 ha. The average size of the CMUs is around 700 ha. Figure 3 shows that not all CMUs have significant areas of plantation forest.  For example, in the west of the Wairoa catchment, most CMUs are in indigenous forest. Only a few have significant areas of plantation forest, and any effects of clearfell harvesting will occur in these CMUs.
