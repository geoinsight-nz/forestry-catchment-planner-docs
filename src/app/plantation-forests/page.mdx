# Plantation forests

New Zealand's forestry industry is largely based around sustainably-managed plantation forests. {{ className: 'lead' }}

About 90% of New Zealand's forests are radiata pine (Pinus radiata). The remainder are Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) amounting to 6% of total plantation area, and other areas are made up by softwood and hardwood species.

    In this example, we request the page that starts after the conversation with id `s4WycXedwhQrEFuM`. As a result, we get a list of three conversations and can tell by the `has_more` attribute that we have reached the end of the resultset.

    <Properties>
      <Property name="starting_after" type="string">
