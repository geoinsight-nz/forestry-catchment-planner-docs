# Classifications

Radiata pine forest stand age is classified according to the following schema:

-

## Detection

The North and South Island regions' datasets were primarily based on LCDB V5.0, supplemented with missing areas identified through the NZ Topo 1:50k Exotic Forest dataset, ensuring a minimum contiguous feature size of 3 hectares. The age classing process utilized LiDAR for base predictions, Hansenâ€™s Global deforestation data for accuracy in overlaps, and LUCAS NZ Forest Clearing data for gaps, with assessments done using Sentinel-2 image time series analysis. Final refinements included grouping LiDAR results into three-year buckets, smoothing internal boundaries, and applying 2023 regional boundaries, ensuring a minimum internal feature size of 1.5 hectares.
