# Stream orders

Stream ordering in a drainage network classifies the hierarchy of channels in a watershed. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
    Stream order classifications are established with reference to NIWA's River Environment Classification (REC); a database of catchment spatial attributes, summarised for every segment in New Zealand's network of rivers.

| Network position (Refer Figure 1) | Order     | Gradient     | Landforms                     | Dominant process  |
|-----------------------------------|-----------|--------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| Zone 1                            | 1,2       | High/steep   | Headwater streams             | Erosion           |
| Zone 2                            | 3,4       | Mid gradient | Pool/riffle, tributaries      | Transfer/storage  |
| Zone 3                            | 5,6,7     | Low gradient | Main stem, floodplains        | Deposition        |

The FCP uses “Catchment Management Units” (CMUs) to divide the landscape up into units for visualising and managing the effects of clearfell harvesting in steepland forests. A CMU is a subcatchment upstream of where `Zone 2` transitions to `Zone 1`. A CMU will therefore contain order 1 and 2 streams that have flowed together to make a 3rd order stream.  

The aim of the FCP is to show the area and location of erosion-susceptible plantation forest within a CMU, since harvesting of this forest will influence the amount of erosion and therefore sediment that flows out of the CMU and into `Zone 2` and `Zone 3`.  To manage this erosion and sediment flowing out of the CMU, we need to manage the area of erosion-susceptible land within the CMU that is in the window of vulnerability at any point in time.
