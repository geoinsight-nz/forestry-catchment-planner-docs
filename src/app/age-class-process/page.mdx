# Age class process

The key difference between a plantation forest and an indigenous forest, at least in NZ, is that the plantation forest will be clearfelled once it is mature. For radiata pine plantations, this is done at an average age of 28 years, although this can be earlier or later depending on the forest owners' objectives. With reference to forestry harvesting cycles we can determine the age of the plantation with the aim of showing where clearfell harvesting is predicted to happen at any time in the future. In this way, we can show how much land will be in the window of vulnerability and where it will be located. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## North Island

The combined accuracy of the Gisborne and Hawkes Bay regions was 71% within a year, 83% within two and 87% within three, after post-processing was applied. Notably, the estimates based on harvest detection (Hansen V1.10 and Sentinel-2) were more accurate than the LiDAR-derived results. 92% of points estimated using Hansen or S2 were within a year, while this dropped to 41% for LiDAR, though 75% of LiDAR points were within three years. The split between the two sources was relatively even, with 59% using Hansen and Sentinel and 41% using LiDAR. 304 points were assessed, which can be viewed by using the North Island QC tool.

## South Island

The combined accuracy of the Nelson, Marlborough and Tasman regions was 86% within a year, 93% within two and 94% within three, after post-processing was applied. The improvement relative to the North Island results was due to the greater proportion of results that we estimated using Hansen and Sentinel-2 (which had a similarly higher degree of accuracy compared to the LiDAR-derived results as the North Island) which thus improved the overall accuracy. About 80% of the QC points were estimated with this data, while the remaining 20% were classified using LiDAR. This difference in proportions likely highlights the younger resource age in these regions, resulting in a greater number of features having a change post 2000 which was then captured by the satellite imagery based data sources 300 points were assessed, which can be viewed by using the South Island QC tool.

## Output

An example of the final output for the South Island, showing the Sentinel-2 basemap and LCDB boundaries (post minimum area filter), then the initial processed dataset, and then the final version post smoothing. Of note are the recent plantings, which are generally captured with Hansen and Sentinel-2, and the earlier, pre-2000 areas which were estimated using LiDAR. Where there are clear edges between harvest and remaining mature forest, the internal boundaries can be quite accurate despite the generalization and smoothing processes that were applied.
