# Age Class Process 

Age class process detects forest stand age in order to predict when clearfell harvesting will happen at any time in the future. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Investigation

The North and South Island regions' plantation forest extents were primarily based on LCDB V5.0 (as mapped in 2018), supplemented with missing areas identified through the NZ Topo 1:50k Exotic Forest dataset, ensuring a minimum contiguous feature size of 3 hectares. This minimum area was selected to reduce dataset complexity and to ensure sufficient data would be available to give an accurate age class estimate.

The age classing process utilised LiDAR for base predictions, with the Hansen Global Forest Change data used instead where possible (change had occurred post-2000). The LUCAS NZ Forest Clearing data was used to fill any remaining gaps. Finally, any additional harvest was detected using Sentinel-2. Additional refinements included grouping LiDAR results into three-year buckets, smoothing internal boundaries, and applying 2023 regional boundaries, ensuring a minimum internal feature size of 1.5 hectares.

The accuracy of the age class predictions was assessed by reviewing the Landsat time series of points randomly distributed within the forest area with the user-assessed value, which was then compared against the estimated value produced by the age class process for the coincident forest unit. Approximately 600 points were assessed across the target regions, split evenly between the North and South Islands.

## North Island Results

The combined accuracy of the age class estimates for the Gisborne and Hawkes Bay regions was 71% of sample point age was estimated within a year of actual stand age, 83% within two years of actual stand age and 87% within three years of actual stand age, after post-processing was applied. Notably, the estimates based on harvest detection (Hansen V1.10 and Sentinel-2) were more accurate than the LiDAR-derived results. Stand age for 92% of points estimated using Hansen or Sentinel-2 were within a year of actual stand age, while this dropped to 41% for LiDAR estimates, although 75% of LiDAR points were within three years of actual stand age. The split between the two stand age sources was relatively even, with 59% using Hansen and Sentinel and 41% using LiDAR.

## South Island Results

The combined accuracy of the age class estimates for the Nelson, Marlborough and Tasman regions was 86% of sample point age was estimated within a year, 93% within two years and 94% within three years, after post-processing was applied. The improvement relative to the North Island results was due to the greater proportion of results that we estimated using the Hansen model and Sentinel-2 (which had a similarly higher degree of accuracy compared to the LiDAR-derived age-class results as the North Island) which thus improved the overall accuracy. About 80% of the age-class QC points were estimated with this data, while the remaining 20% were classified using LiDAR. This difference in proportions between the North and South Islands likely highlights the younger resource age in the South Island, resulting in a greater number of features having a change post 2000 which was then captured by the satellite imagery based data sources.

## Example Output

An example of the final output for stand age-class estimations for the South Island with a Sentinel-2 basemap. Of note are the recent plantings, which are generally captured with Hansen and Sentinel-2, and the earlier, pre-2000 areas which were estimated using LiDAR. Where there are clear edges between harvest and remaining mature forest, the internal boundaries can be quite accurate despite the generalisation and smoothing processes that were applied.

<Note>
    The decision to exclude small woodlots from the current display of information was made to simplify data complexity. This approach also impacts the age classification process; smaller features, such as small woodlots, receive fewer LiDAR and satellite data 'hits,' which complicates the estimation of their age. The age classification relies heavily on the capture date of the imagery used for harvest detection.
