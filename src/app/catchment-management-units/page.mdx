# Catchment Management Units (CMUs)

Catchment Management Units are referred to as CMUs. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
    To identify CMUs, we used the River Environment Classification (REC2) from NIWA:

The FCP uses “Catchment Management Units” (CMUs) to divide the landscape up into units for visualising and managing the effects of clearfell harvesting in steepland forests. A CMU is a subcatchment upstream of where `Zone 2` transitions to `Zone 1`. A CMU will therefore contain order 1 and 2 streams that have flowed together to make a 3rd order stream.  

## Structure

An important feature of catchments is that they usually have a structure like a tree.  This structure can be understood in terms of stream orders (Figure 2), where the smallest and highest subcatchments in `Zone 1` are classified stream order 1.  Downstream, where two order 1 streams meet is the beginning of a stream order 2; where two order 2 streams meet, is the beginning of an order 3 stream and so on.  By the time `Zone 3` (floodplains) is reached, the main stem of the catchment “tree” may be classified as order 5, 6 or even 7.

CMUs are the basis for dividing up larger scale catchments as they deliver water, sediment, and woody debris to the main floodplain areas of larger catchments (Stream order 5 or greater).
