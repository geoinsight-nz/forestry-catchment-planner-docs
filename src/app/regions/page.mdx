# Regions

The project initially targets five key regions: Te Tauihu (Tasman, Nelson, Marlborough), Te Matau-a-Māui (Hawkes Bay), and Tairāwhiti (Gisborne), with the goal of expanding deployment throughout Aotearoa. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Each region exposed particular challenges that our methodology was forced to address including but not limited to: an inconsistent picture of forest stand locations and ages across New Zealand’s regions, inaccessibility of forestry data in the context of catchments and time, and difficulty assessing the vulnerability of the land forests were planted on. {{ className: 'lead' }}

    ## Study Areas

    <Properties>
      <Property name="Te Tai o Aorere" type="Tasman">
        Tasman contains the oldest rocks of anywhere on New Zealand. It contains all the main terranes that make up New Zealand's basement. These basement rocks include Ultramafic rocks, such as Serpentine and Dunite, and valuable minerals, such as Gold.
      </Property>
      <Property name="Whakatū" type="Nelson">
        Nelson’s limestones, marbles, granites, mudstones and ultramafic rocks are geologically part of rock groups found west of the Alpine Fault. These are quite diverse and complex compared to the greywacke mountains of the Southern Alps, east of the fault.

      </Property>
      <Property name="Te Tauihu-o-te-waka" type="Marlborough">
        North of the fault, Marlborough shares Nelson’s geology and landforms. It is mostly hill country, including the Richmond Range and the coastal valleys of the Rai, Pelorus, Kaituna and Tuamarina rivers.

      </Property>
      <Property name="Te Matau-a-Māui" type="Hawkes Bay">
        The geology of the Napier-Hastings area is dominated by Late Quaternary alluvial and marine sediments forming the Heretaunga Plains. These overlie older Quaternary sediments that are exposed in lower hills and these in turn overlie Pliocene alternating mudstone, sandstone and limestone.
