# Glossary

Key terms and definitions used throughout the Forestry Catchment Planner documentation.

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Forestry Catchment Planner (FCP) | A tool to visualise underlying geospatial data for managing plantation forests and clearfell harvesting on erosion-susceptible lands. |
| Window of Vulnerability | The period of 6-8 years post-clearfell harvest during which land is more susceptible to erosion due to the loss of tree root reinforcement and canopy cover. |
| Root Reinforcement | The soil reinforcing effect of a forest’s root network, which helps to bind soils together and anchor them to the underlying rock formation. |
| Umbrella Effect | The interception and evaporation of rainfall by a forest canopy, which helps keep forest soils drier and stronger than soils under shorter vegetation. |
| Catchment Management Units (CMUs) | Subcatchments within a larger catchment area used to manage and visualise the effects of clearfell harvesting.|
| Hillslope Units (HSUs) | Smaller divisions within CMUs that represent areas similar in erosion susceptibility, typically in first or second-order subcatchments. |
| Rainfall-Induced Landslide (RIL) Susceptibility Model | A model developed by GNS Science to predict the spatial distribution of landslides triggered by rainfall events. |
| Melton Ratio (Melton-R) | A measure of a catchment's average steepness or ruggedness, used to classify debris flow susceptibility. |
| Erosion Susceptibility | The predisposition of a land unit to erode, determined by its soil characteristics, geology, and topographic features. |
| Mass Movement Erosion | Erosion types where material moves downslope as a coherent mass under gravity, including soil slips, debris flows, and earthflows. |
| Fluvial Erosion | Erosion involving the removal of soil material by running water, such as gully erosion. |
| Land Use Capability (LUC) | A classification system used to distinguish between different erosion processes and land units in New Zealand. |
| Sediment | Particles of soil, sand, and minerals that are transported by water or wind and deposited in a new location. |
| Landslide | The movement of rock, earth, or debris down a sloped section of land. |
| Debris Flow | A type of landslide involving the rapid flow of soil and rock mixed with water down a slope. |
| Soil Slip | A shallow, rapid slide and flow involving soil and underlying weathered rock. |
| Earthflow | The slow movement of soil and regolith, usually along deep shear planes, often creating a hummocky surface. |
| Gully Erosion | The removal of soil material by channelized running water, leading to the formation of gullies. |
| Fluvio Gully-Mass Movement Complexes | Large gullies that involve both fluvial and mass movement erosion processes, common in the Tairāwhiti/Gisborne-East Coast region. |
| Lidar | A remote sensing technology that measures distance by illuminating a target with laser light and analyzing the reflected light. |
| Geospatial Data | Information that is associated with a specific location on the Earth's surface. |
| Clearfell Harvesting | The practice of cutting down all the trees in an area at once. |
| Social Licence to Operate | The ongoing acceptance and approval of a company's activities by local communities and other stakeholders. |
| Tino Rangatiratanga | The exercise of absolute chieftainship, often associated with Maori sovereignty and self-determination. |
| Mana Motuhake | The principle of self-determination and autonomy, particularly for Maori communities. |
| Throughfall | The process by which precipitation passes through the canopy of a forest or vegetated area and reaches the ground, either directly through gaps or by dripping off leaves and branches. |
