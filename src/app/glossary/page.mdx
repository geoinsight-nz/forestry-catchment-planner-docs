# Glossary

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Forestry Catchment Planner (FCP) | A tool to create underlying geospatial data for managing plantation forests and clearfell harvesting on erosion-susceptible lands. |
| Window of Vulnerability | The period of 6-8 years post-clearfell harvest during which land is more susceptible to erosion due to the loss of tree root reinforcement and canopy cover. |
| Root Reinforcement | The soil reinforcing effect of a forestâ€™s root network, which helps to bind soils together and anchor them to the underlying rock formation. |
| Umbrella Effect | The interception and evaporation of rainfall by a forest canopy, which helps keep forest soils drier and stronger than soils under shorter vegetation. |
| Catchment Management Units (CMUs) | Subcatchments within a larger catchment area used to manage and visualize the effects of clearfell harvesting.|
| Hillslope Units (HSUs) | Smaller divisions within CMUs that represent areas similar in erosion susceptibility, typically in first or second-order subcatchments. |
| Rainfall-Induced Landslide (RIL) Susceptibility Model | A model developed to predict the spatial distribution of landslides triggered by rainfall events. |
| Melton Ratio (Melton-R) | A measure of a catchment's average steepness or ruggedness, used to classify debris flow susceptibility. |
| Erosion Susceptibility | The predisposition of a land unit to erode, determined by its soil characteristics, geology, and topographic features. |
| Mass Movement Erosion | Erosion types where material moves downslope as a coherent mass under gravity, including soil slips, debris flows, and earthflows. |
| Fluvial Erosion | Erosion involving the removal of soil material by running water, such as gully erosion. |
