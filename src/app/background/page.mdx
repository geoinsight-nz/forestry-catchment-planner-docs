# Background

Approximately 25% of New Zealand’s plantation forests are located on steep, erosion-susceptible lands. These steepland plantations do a great job of reducing soil erosion—the contribution of NZ’s plantations to avoided erosion has been valued at nearly $1 billion per year (Yao et al. 2021).  However, plantation forests are usually clear-felled when mature, and the steepland plantations are no exception.  Clearfelling on erosion-susceptible lands results in a "window of vulnerability” of around six years, until the replanted trees grow large enough to protect the soil (Phillips et al. 2024). We do not want to lose the benefits of plantations in reducing soil erosion—we need to carefully stage our forest harvesting to manage the areas within the window of vulnerability, especially on erosion-susceptible land. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Planning

Local councils, landowners, and the forestry sector are working to enhance their management and mitigation of future environmental impacts. Central to this effort is the ambitions to improve access to vital information about forestry stand locations, recent harvest, and forthcoming harvesting schedules.

## Mitigation

The project aims to create an online spatial decision support tool to help visual forestry stand age data and predict hazard profiles in catchments of different sizes. This involves visualising future intergenerational harvesting cycles, downstream hazards, and the natural susceptibility of areas typically prone to erosion.

## Approach

This approach aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of harvesting cycles on a catchment scale, which is essential for proactive environmental stewardship.
