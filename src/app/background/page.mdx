# Background

New Zealand's plantation forests are highly effectively at preventing soil erosion. Erosion damage avoided as a result of plantation forests saves New Zealand nearly $1 billion annually. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Planning

Local councils, landowners, and the forestry sector are working to enhance their management and mitigation of future environmental impacts. Central to this effort is the ambitions to improve access to vital information about forestry stand locations, recent harvest, and forthcoming harvesting schedules.

## Mitigation

The project aims to create an online spatial decision support tool to help visual forestry stand age data and predict hazard profiles in catchments of different sizes. This involves visualising future intergenerational harvesting cycles, downstream hazards, and the natural susceptibility of areas typically prone to erosion.

## Approach

This approach aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of harvesting cycles on a catchment scale, which is essential for proactive environmental stewardship.
