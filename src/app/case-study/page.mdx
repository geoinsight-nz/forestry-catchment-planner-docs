# Case Study Overview

This case study illustrates the diverse functionalities of the FCP through the analysis of Catchment Management Units (CMUs) within the larger Wairoa Catchment in Northern Hawkes Bay. It explores questions that have been raised during our stakeholder engagement discussions with Iwi, Regional Councils, and Forest Industry Representatives across Te Tauihu (Top of the South Island), Tairawhiti (Gisborne) and Te Matau-a-MƒÅui (Hawkes Bay). The study demonstrates how the FCP tool can improve understanding and decision-making for sustainable environmental management in the Wairoa Catchment. Additionally, it explores how these stakeholders can ensure long-term stewardship by identifying and planning to address potential risks associated with plantation forest harvesting upstream.
