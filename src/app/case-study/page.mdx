# Case Study Overview

This case study illustrates the diverse functionalities of the FCP through the analysis of Catchment Management Units (CMUs) within the larger Wairoa Catchment in Northern Hawkes Bay. It explores questions that have been raised during our stakeholder engagement discussions with Iwi, Regional Councils, and Forest Industry Representatives across Te Tauihu (Top of the South Island), Tairawhiti (Gisborne) and Te Matau-a-Māui (Hawkes Bay). The study demonstrates how the FCP tool can improve understanding and decision-making for sustainable environmental management in the Wairoa Catchment. Additionally, it explores how these stakeholders can ensure long-term stewardship by identifying and planning to address potential risks associated with plantation forest harvesting upstream.

## Wairoa Catchment 

Hawke’s Bay catchments have been grouped into seven ‘catchment zones’. The Wairoa and Northern Catchments is one such zone (See image below).

This large zone includes the main Wairoa catchment and smaller coastal catchments of Whakaki, Nuhaka and Mahia. The Wairoa catchment covers 3,674 km2 and drains the eastern flanks of the Te Urewera and the Huiarau Range.  Rivers and lakes are integral to the catchment’s character and wellbeing: these comprise Lake Waikaremoana and Lake Waikereiti, and the Wairoa, Waiau, Waikaretaheke,  Mangaaruhe, Ruakituri, Hangaroa and Mangapoike Rivers. 
The Wairoa River is significant to the iwi and hapū of Te Rohe o Te Wairoa, ecologically as well as for recreation and mahinga kai. Lakes, river systems and coastal lagoons/wetlands are ecologically rich, supporting native fish, including critically threatened longfin eel and koaro. There are large populations of brown and rainbow trout in many rivers.
Water quality is generally good, but suspended sediment and poor visual clarity are issues caused by a combination of erodible soils, high rainfall and land use practices. Soft sedimentary (“soft-rock) hill country is dominant with hard greywacke and argillite forming higher hill country in the west. Soft-rock hill country landscapes are susceptible to erosion, and intense rainfall and tectonic activity trigger frequent landslide erosion events. The alluvial sediments of the lower Wairoa valley and coastal plain are naturally fertile, but with areas of poor drainage. 
Indigenous forest dominates in the greywacke ranges of Te Urewera in the west, but elsewhere hill country pasture and commercial forestry predominate.  There has been transition from pastoral farming to plantation forestry in recent years, particularly on economically marginal land. Intensive cropping and horticulture occur on limited areas of fertile lowlands.
The Wairoa catchment is sparsely populated with small communities. Wairoa is the only main service town, with SH2 links to Napier and Gisborne, a small airport and rail link (freight only). The small rural centre of Frasertown includes basic services. Many rural roads are unsealed. 
The zone has a declining population with significant outmigration of younger people. There is a higher proportion of lower incomes than the rest of region. The local economy is dominated by primary production and processing, with heavy reliance on two main processing works for employment. Forestry is of growing importance. Coastal/ecotourism and recreation are the other economic drivers.
