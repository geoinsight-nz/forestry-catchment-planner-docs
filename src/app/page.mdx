# Forestry Catchment Planner Documentation

Use this documentation to access the science, methodology, and guides for engaging with the Forestry Catchment Planner web application. The pages of the docs are organised sequentially, from the foundational science through to the project's methodological approach, and the configuration of the web application tool. These chapters can also be used as a resource to seek out additional detail as and when required for specific use cases. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## About

The National Science Challenge [Our Land and Water](https://ourlandandwater.nz/) is a strategic research initiative in New Zealand dedicated to enhancing the sustainable use and management of land and water resources. By integrating cutting-edge science and innovative practices, the challenge aims to improve the productivity, profitability, and environmental health of New Zealand’s primary industries. It seeks to foster collaboration among researchers, industry stakeholders, and communities to address critical issues such as soil erosion, water quality, and climate change. Through its comprehensive approach, Our Land and Water aspires to create resilient agricultural systems that support both economic growth and the preservation of natural ecosystems for future generations. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Key questions

This project was funded by the Our Land & Water Science Challenge and was initiated to explore several questions: {{ className: 'lead' }}

- Where are the exotic forests located across Te Tauihu, Te Matau-a-Māui, and Tairāwhiti, and how can we classify them by age to identify maturing forests? {{ className: 'lead' }}
- How can we visualise regions and catchments where significant clearfell harvesting is anticipated, and assess the associated risks for potential mass erosion? {{ className: 'lead' }}
- Can we identify areas approaching harvest and classify the underlying land's vulnerability to landslides, as well as predict the probability of debris flows in the context of large storm events? {{ className: 'lead' }}
- How do we understand and manage the intergenerational risks arising from the overlap of forestry harvesting cycles and extreme weather events? {{ className: 'lead' }}
- What measures can empower tangata whenua to protect cultural heritage while promoting holistic land use thinking and proactive catchment planning? {{ className: 'lead' }}
